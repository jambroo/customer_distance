# Customer Distance

This NodeJs project reads in a JSON file (customers.json), and calculates distances between people in the file and a given point. These results are filtered by distances greater than 100km and sorted by the provided user IDs. The result of the script being run is a list of user IDs and the user's full name being output to the console.
